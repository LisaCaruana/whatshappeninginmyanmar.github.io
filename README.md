In the early hours of February 2, 2021, the Myanmar military staged a coup, overthrowing a democratically elected government and seizing power. Citizens started engaging in peaceful protests the following day and since then the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) has only grown. This is the second military coup to occur in the country, which lived under military rule from 1962-2011. Previous attempts by the population to oust the military government have been met with deadly force by the Myanmar military and police and this time has been no different. Dozens of peaceful protesers have been shot and killed by government forces to date,
with many shot in the head - suggesting targeted and deliberate killings. The military has been arresting members of the CDM movement at night and attempting to limit internet access and other forms of communication with the outside world.

I lived in Mandalay, Myanmar in 2015, where I taught at a local monastic school. Many of my former students and friends are currently involved in the Civil Disobedience Movement.
